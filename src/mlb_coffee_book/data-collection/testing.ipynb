      "Hey. The home of the twins. Timberwolves. Wild and Lynx.Twins in Arizona. Getting set to wrap up this three game series. Going for a series win here from Chase Field in Phoenix as the Minnesota Twins wrap things up against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Hi everybody. Welcome back to the ballpark alongside former twins all star closer Glen Perkins. I'm Corey Provus Aldry Martin from the field in just a moment. So far so good for the twins on this three city road trip. The twins won two out of three in Oakland and go for the series win today here against Arizona. And a lot of excitement around this twins team today as we will see the major league debut of the twins top pitching prospect of David Festa. Probably the most anticipated debut since eight years ago, when Jose Berríos debuted for the twins. They're very excited about this young man right here and it's been a developmental success story for the twins. The rise that he's had through the minor league organization to now becoming one of the better strikeout pitchers in Triple-A. He is ready. He's refined his command as this season has gone on, and peaking at the right time. His walk rate all the way down to zero. The last two starts, 16 strikeouts, no walks. He was a high 80s guy coming out of college. His fastball mid upper 90s can touch 100 miles an hour. Didn't even throw a slider in college, and that's been his best strikeout pitch. He gets a lot of swing and misses with the fastball and slider, and we'll see if he can command it here in the big leagues this afternoon. A good look at the pitching profile of David Festa as part of our Liberty Mutual Insurance field coverage. Jose Miranda had a big game last night. He joined Aldry post game. In fact, Aldry has more on the twins third baseman and DH. When we come back.Popped up.What's up? Top.Twins. Baseball on Bally Sports is brought to you by menards.

It's afternoon baseball inside Chase field as the twins look to take the series in a rubber match. Matinee against the Diamondbacks. Hi, everyone. Welcome back to Arizona. I'm Audra Martin. There were a lot of standout performances last night in the eight run, 14 hit effort from the twins, but it's impossible to overlook the effort from Jose Miranda. Matching a career high with a three hit night, Miranda slugged two doubles in a single, not to mention clearing the bases with the first double of the night. It was part of a red hot June that has him hitting 329 with eight doubles, a triple, three home runs and 16 RBI in 21 games. Now last night, Rocco Baldelli was asked how much of his rebound season is about Miranda being healthy versus any changes or adjustments he may have made. And Rocco said they'll never truly know exactly, but whatever it is they love what they see. We're seeing a guy right now that, you know, can hit a pitch at his neck if he puts his mind, if he's preparing to get on top of a fastball, he can get on top of a fastball up in the zone. He's on off speed pitches. He can shoot the ball the other way. He can do a lot of different things and sometimes your health can limit you. And, you know, you take away a guy's strengths. I mean, it's a hard game, but right now that seems to be a thing of the past. And he he's, I think where he wants to be right now, both in the big leagues and playing the way he's playing. Miranda and the rest of the twins look for another big day at the plate in this afternoon's series finale. First pitch from the desert is next.Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop Pop. Pop. Pop.

Welcome back to Chase field. All closed up today. On this warm day here in Phoenix. Twins set to mark the halfway point of their 2024 season. Game number 81 today. Twins at 44 and 36. And Rocco's team would be a playoff team if play ended. As of today, the twins right now the second wild card team if the postseason format was finalized, but still a whole nother half of baseball left to go, and the twins seeing a left handed starter that means it's all righties and switch hitters today. Brought to you by menards . Typical right handed lineup for Rocco today. Margot Correia, Lewis Miranda, Santana Jeffers, Buxton Castro, farmer. Jordan Montgomery on the mound for the Diamondbacks today. His stats brought to you by home Furniture. He didn't sign until the end of March, so it's been a slow start to the season for Montgomery. Career highs in just about everything last year and maybe showing some signs of turning the corner here over the last couple of starts. He has been better. Sinker. Curveball, changeup, four seamer. Slider. He throws a lot of sinkers. That usage has gone up here recently. Defensively behind Montgomery today brought to you by Ford. No change in the outfield. Gurriel Carroll and McCarthy. One change with the infield Kevin Newman who played shortstop while Geraldo Perdomo was out with injury, will start at third base for the first time this season. He has played plenty of third in the past, but his first start at third and Jose Herrera, his first appearance behind the plate and hopefully some early run support coming up for David Festa making his big league debut today. Manuel Margot leads off and the first pitch is bounced foul and we are underway here in Phoenix. Twins as a team. Great numbers for a while now against left handed pitching . And Montgomery, a lefty and Margot good numbers lifetime against the Arizona starter. And now it's 0 and 2 and Manny in particular last 11 games against left handed pitching batting average at 440 with some power behind that Ops well over. A thousand. The twins can avoid chasing that will enhance their chances today, because Montgomery doesn't possess big strikeout numbers this season. No. And the strikeout rate way down from his career. He's usually a low to mid 20s strikeout rate guy. It's all the way down under 16% this year. Fastball velocity down. But a sinker ball guy. And we've talked about it a couple times here on this road trip. Try to hit that sinker the other way. It's going to help you avoid hitting it on the ground. And that should give them a better chance against some of these slower changeups curveballs that Montgomery's going to throw. Once again, the one two to Margot hit up the middle, but the second baseman could tell Marte hadn't played perfectly, and Margot grounds out to begin game three. Ketel Marte might start all star game for the National League. He'll bat. Second win. Arizona comes up in the bottom half of the inning, so One down Carlos Correa. We see him hit second often against lefties. More in the five slot against righties. With those numbers here in June. Boy does he have a plan. Every single day about what he envisions doing against an opposing pitcher and a first pitch, ground ball single to center? Last night, part of a three hit game was on four times. And I was asking him about that today on the bus right in. And he said his first two rounds of BP with hitting coach David Hopkins, it was all ground balls up the middle. He's noticed where the second baseman, in this case Marte, has been shading him more towards that hole between first and second base. So Correa thought there would be more opportunity up the middle and took advantage. But now, with a ground ball arm and a lefty Montgomery, we do see Marte kind of shift over more up the middle a little bit more. Not as much as Margot kind of halfway in between, maybe straightaway second and where they had Margot played right up the middle, right. Kind of right on that shift line. But Correia's base hit basically right at where the second base umpire is last night that first at bat. So there still is a pretty big hole if you go back through the middle, especiallyn the pull side. But he had mentioned it. It was the fact that he was hitting line drives the other way. They started to move over and then he adjusted to that by working back up toward the middle of the field again. And this is hard hit up the middle. And Correia stays red hot over his last. Now 1920 games average power, four homers, four doubles. Adding to that with a sharp single here in the opening inning. Well, and that's where you hit that one last night. Kind of that same spot just to the left of second base umpire Andy Fletcher. Big hole back through the middle. And now Royce Lewis, he's due for his last 14. Longest hitless streak of his career. He's been swinging early on this road trip but takes a changeup for a strike. Three straight hitless games for Lewis first time. That's ever happened in his young big league career. And Royce has good numbers, though, against left handed pitching this season. Shows this one to left shallow. Gurriel coming in. He'll make the catch two down. So Lewis lines out one. It's up to Jose Miranda Listher Dondrei reference Miranda and his run here. That's 18 games, eight extra base hits. He's batting just shy of 400 and had an impressive game last night. He's on four times. Two doubles. He drove in three. Lined up the middle right back towards Montgomery and Correia down to second as Miranda is now four for five in this series. Keep the line moving for Carlos Santana right back up through the middle again. He got Lewis out on his front foot on the changeup. Just a little bit. But I like this going right back up through the middle. Both Correa and Miranda. Hard singles right through the box Santana. Good numbers lifetime against Montgomery two on two out as he doesn't chase out a change up low. Santana three for eight in the series with a double. But against Montgomery it's a small sample. Nine at bats, four hits with a home run. Correia is at second. Miranda is at first. Early chance for the twins here in game three, chopped to third. Second up is played by Newman. Goes to second for the force on Miranda and the twins don't score and leave. Two. When we come back, the major league debut of new Jersey native David Festa.Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop.InIn all, David Festa left 17 tickets for friends and family today. Moments away from his big league debut, Rocco Baldelli was asked earlier why Festa and why now? It's a combination of a couple of things that will always lead to us making one of these decisions, he's been fulfilling his obligations by having good stuff, by being in the strike zone a good amount, by missing a bunch of bats, he's throwing the ball the way we want him to, and he's ready for this. And a strike on Corbin Carroll and now a swing and miss on a change up. Oh, and two home furniture starting stats for David Festa. That's the minor leagues. Lot of strikeouts. He's cut his walk rate down as the season has gone on to the right side. And Kyle Farmer makes the routine play on Corbin Carroll just like that. You got your first one out of the way. So Carroll is retired one down and Ketel Marte is coming up. Switch hitting Arizona second baseman as we take a look at the Arizona lineup. Brought to you by menards. Yeah the top of the order is the same for the third straight day. A couple changes at the bottom Newman in there today. Perdomo moves up from 9 to 8. Herrera behind the plate as opposed to Barnhart. We saw him the first two nights. Martínez having a wonderful season. Likely all star bound Change-Up evens up the count. Leading vote getter right now amongst National League second baseman. He's hit 16 home runs. The one one is fouled back and it's 1 and. So Festa so far filling up the strike zone filling up the strike zone. And I like that we're seeing that change up early. Establish that pitch I think is going to be important. That's his third best pitch I think his slider is his number one pitch swing. And miss wise, all of that. Both lefties and righties. He's obviously got the fastball velocity, but I like that he's not overthrowing. He looks composed out there. If he does, if he was overthrowing what would stand out to you that mechanically he's doing just that? I would say falling off the mound and not having seen him throw live ever, but falling off the mound, arm side high, missing up in the zone. I think he looks under control. Playable to left center for Willie Castro . And there were two down. The twins defensively behind Festa today. Willie Castro. Could he be an all star. He's making a strong case. He's in left field here today for game three. The infield of Luis Correia farmer Santana and Ryan Jeffers behind the plate for David Festa's major league debut. Oh a rookie against a veteran in Joc Pederson as a change up at night, he misses outside for ball one. Pederson one for seven in this series. Great numbers against right handed pitching. And fouled back. There's 97. Festa hit 100 miles an hour earlier this season. He averaged 95 though at Triple-A with his fastball and still seeking his first big league strikeout, got ahead of Carroll. He grounded out Martich a flyout and now 1 and 2 on Peterson. Born in Verona, new Jersey, the 399th overall pick. In 2021, quite the developmental success story. He was an upper 80s fastball guy coming out of Seton Hall, really took to the twins kind of velocity building program that they have. Check. Swing ground ball to the right side and farmer is going to throw out Peters. And a nice start for David Festa. Three up, three down.This reminder to get out and play with the Minnesota Lottery. Tune in to the next twins home game to find out how you could join the Minnesota Lottery winner's circle and win $50 in scratch tickets. No score. As we start the second. Ryan Jeffers, a huge game tying home run earlier in this series down a strike, and David Festa, known as the Slim Reaper with a good start to his big league career. Take a seat, slim. Take a load off. Another line drive. Base hit. The twins have three hits, all singles as Jeffers is on to begin the second. Montgomery's got to feel like he's got a target on his back. That's three line drives right back at him. He's starting to flinch a little bit. So, Jeffers now with a seven game hitting streak. Two for four in this series. And Byron Buxton last 16 games, two homers, a triple, four doubles. He has scored 11 runs. All went Montgomery's way. OPS over 950. His last 16 games. Seeing him often hitting seventh as he is again today. And the twins are going to be fine if they don't chase that changeup down today. That's going to enhance their success, to keep that fastball up in the zone more than anything else. That they do. Don't chase Off speed below the strike zone. And Buxton doesn't bite again. And now a 2-1 count Montgomery right now just doesn't have the velocity with his fastball to be super effective in the zone, he has to be on the edges. He has to get Chase outside of the zone to have success. And fastball down the middle. But Buxton could not get the timing right. And now 2 and 2. So he's avoided chasing early in the count. Now we'll see if Montgomery and Herrera go back to that with two strikes. Yeah. And it could be the changeup. It could be a slow breaking ball. But he's trying to he's trying to get a ground ball here. Even though buck tough to double up with. Nobody out. Guy on first tried to get that ground ball. If nothing else you keep Buck at first. But that's Montgomery's game plan. He's not going to get strikeouts. Try to get the twins to hit the ball on the ground, towards the hole and into left field. The base hit. So it was a ground ball, but Buxton hit it sharply and the twins threatening again. Two on. Nobody out. And here comes Willie Castro hitting eighth today riding a nine game hitting streak. And from this side of the plate last night went deep early. He's come alive at the right side of the plate. This year a 581 slugging percentage as a right handed hitter a couple of years ago with the Tigers, he slugged 387. And just further development and. Just adjustments that he's made in a twins uniform. This would cut off the mound, took an odd bounce and the only play will be close at first. And Castro beat it out. Some hesitation there from Marte. It hit the mound, took an odd hop, but then Marte took a glance at second base when he realized who the runner was that cost him. I don't know if he had trouble getting that ball out of his glove. If Perdomo wasn't quite to second base. Yeah, that thing had a ton of sidespin off the mound. Funny hop right here, Marte. He was going to flip and for whatever reason didn't. And then Castro is able to beat it out. They're going to give him a single. So bases loaded, nobody out. And Kyle Farmer, his first at bat in this series, one for seven on the road trip. And a little curveball. Strike one. Farmer often has been batting with runners in scoring position. Infield is back. Zero and two. Farmer has one career grand slam that came in 2021. The twins, as a team, don't have a grand slam. And farmer chased a little curveball. So a key out there for Montgomery. One away and it's up to Manuel Margot. That's a slow curveball. And Naswell backed it up with that fastball to get to two strikes. Farmer can't hold up. Early momentum moment in this game as the lineup turns over. Three on, one out. No score. Margot grounded out his first time twins had bases loaded last night, and Jose Miranda cleared him early in the game, and that did swing the momentum got the twins offense going. Margot one for four with the bases loaded this season. Pulled foul. Twins numbers as a team have improved with the bases loaded as a team in terms of average hitting 214, 24th in baseball. But the twins the first month or so of the season were dead last in spots like this. No balls and two strikes on Margot towards the hole. Hit weakly, and a diving stop made by Perdomo. No out recorded and a run scores as Jeffers is in and the twins take a one. Nothing lead. Perdomo made a diving stop to save a second run because Buxton would have scored that ball, found the turf and left Bayron scores easily. But still the run is in and the twins take the first lead. Yeah, Byron Buxton was going until he saw Tommy Watkins, so he had to shut it down. Nice play by Perdomo just to save a run. Didn't even know he had that ball in his glove. And now Correa one for one today and does not bite on the low changeup. And Jose Herrera is going to jog out and have a conversation here with Montgomery. The early welfare check Montgomery two. He could say you know what. And with Herrera we're getting the ground balls. But for the twins, they're in good spots. A couple of hard hit, couple of seeing, I guess. We call him Buck. Hit his hard. Sometimes you just hit him in the right spot and we saw the hard hit balls. Even out last night. The other part of that is the soft, the soft contact, weak contact fluctuates as well. Saw that Correia this season has not had many chances with the bases loaded. Has two career grand slams, including one he hit last year. That'll get fouled. Correia batting now. Bases are loaded. There's only one out. And speaking of bases loaded, Mister Grand Slam himself. Lewis would hit next. That's the one that farmer chased. Well, the one one fastball. Correia was a little bit late on, but I think he's just letting it. Letting the stball get deep. He's not worried about getting beat by it. And then that allows him to just spit on that. I mean, he made no attempt at all to swing at that curveball. Now, the two two pitch in the dirt. And now Montgomery must throw a strike here. Barría. So far, this season, producing the highest line drive rate of his career, Buxton, Castro and Margot. Good speed on here for the twins. And A32 count to Carlos Correia. Now the payoff pitch hit foul a fastball at 93, and we are going to have catcher's interference on Herrera and Correia will reach and Buxton will score. And the twins take a two nothing lead. Now catcher's interference is reviewable. But no arguing from the Diamondbacks. So Herrera, charged with an error and there was contact. And the twins have a two nothing lead. His pitching coach, Brant Strom, is coming out to chat with Montgomery. And if you're Royce Lewis, you're zero for your last 15 bases loaded. This is a comfort zone and comfort time for that guy. Noé moments been too big for him. Bases loaded. Playoffs, first games of the season. He rises to the occasion . Five career grand slams and he just turned 25 years old. Five Grand slams and 13 at bats. All the pressure is on the pitcher. Still just one out. And the twins last night chased the Arona starter, Ryan Nelson, early. He did not get through four in the pitch count. Climbing he for Montgomery and a lengthy second. Nats pulled foul. Lewis DH last night. Back at third today. Expanded there on the changeup. He pulled the fastball. Foul And that for me, was always. It was an auto slider for me. I didn't throw a changeup, but pretty typical pattern there. And now Lewis in a hole, chopped to third. That's a fair ball. Backhanded by Newman. Throws it into right field. Two runs will score as Correia makes third and the twins head on to now lead four. Nothing That ball picked up some top spin, pushing Newman back near the line through high of second and two more score. I think the only play that he had was to second base that ball. Like you said, topspin kind of a chopper. Two big hops. He ends up in foul territory and all he's got is a quick snap throw to second base, and he overthrew it. Would have been a really, really good play had he been able to make it. So now Jose Miranda, the eighth twin to bat. For Miranda had a base hit back in the first inning. Hit high in the air to left center field in the gap. Gurriel chasing. Still going with the play. He'll make the catch, but Correia will tag and score. Productive plate appearance for Miranda as he picks up his 34th RBI and the twins now lead five. Nothing. Very nice, but taking advantage of a indecisive play by Marte at second throwing error. Nice job by Miranda to get the runner in from third base. Lewis, by the way, credited with a fielder's choice, one RBI and then Margot's run scoring on the Newman throwing error. So now Santana, the ninth twin to bat as the twins put up a high five and not ye done here in the second.Santana. Good numbers from this side of the plate was better last year. From his natural side . The right side. He told us yesterday he did not start switch hitting until just a few months before he was allowed to sign. Yeah 15, 16 years old. I think what he said was that they want you to be a catcher and to be a catcher. They want switch hitting. Easy enough. Ahead two. One. Low strike 2 and 2. That was the 30th. Pitch thrown by Montgomery here in the second. Mike Molinski behind the plate here for the series finale. David Festa pitcher's best friend. Good defense. Yeah, but also run support. I wonder if he's sat down this inning yet. He has not sat down. He's been his feet the entire half inning. And Santana started. Did not go. And now Lewis will be off. Full count to the switch. Hitting first baseman. Lewis runs and the three two lined to left. There's a base hit. This one has some speed. That one is rolling. Rolling and missed by Gurriel and finds the wall and Lewis. A late pickup of Tommy Watkins but still will score easily. Looking back at Tommy with a bit of a smile. Santana with an RBI double. It's a six nothing twins lead. Ke'Bryan Martínez Gurriel try to stop that ball. If he does, then perhaps Lewis stays at third base. Well, once that ball missed the glove, it was a no brainer. Yeah Santana got a breaking ball up in the zone. And you see it right there. Just sneak under Gurriel's glove Tommy Watkins he likes to hide that wave. Oh Oh, Hank Conger is going to need an ice bag after the game. Jeffers smiling twins dugout is loving this as well. Right now, as Hank was in foul territory. But take a look at this Doink. Yep. Oh. Second at bat for Jeffers here in the six run. Second. And there is nothing happening right now in the Arizona bullpen.That's a foul ball. So much of this half inning, the success, this half inning. I think going back to what the twins have done well against Montgomery outside of a few guys and a few pitches they've avoided chasing. Yep Well, that's how that's how Santana ended up getting a breaking ball in the zone. He took one below. And yeah, they just they haven't expanded the zone in Montgomery said it right at the beginning. He's right now does not have the kind of stuff that he's accustomed to that he had last season in that late start that he got to his season. Has come back to bite him. Another full count. They've hit the ball hard. They've taken advantage of mistakes. And mistakes will happen. But can you take advantage of them? They've done that this inning. Castro ran hard out of the box on a grounder to second base. Marte hesitated, and that was all it took. Full count Santana leads off second, three two. Jeffers smokes one of the gap in right center field, drifting over. McCarthy is there to make the play to end the inning, but the twins bat around and put up six and give David Festa in his big league debut. Some early run support here in Phoenix.Pop. Pop. Pop. Pop.

Walker two for eight in this series, 17 home runs, including four over his last seven here at home. Six early runs is going to give Festa a little freedom here to just relax. You don't have to hang on every pitch. Not every single pitch is consequential. There's a little freedom to just go right at these Diamondbacks hitters. Probably felt like he was in the dugout for three hours. Behind Walker, two one. Helped him out there 2 and 2. Torey Lovullo, Arizona's manager, was asked about facing Festa earlier today and something that Torey mentioned that looking at Festa in his minor league numbers, mentioning that he's had some bouts of erratic command, and this one is playable to left and shallow and Castro is in. He'll make the play and there is out number one that he thought part of Arizona's game plan coming in was to wait him out a little bit . But we saw Corbin Carroll swing early to begin the game, and Walker helped out Festa there before flying out to left. But he brought that up pregame to his team. Yeah. And I think that some of that is in Festa's control. He can get a head strike one and dictate these at bats and these counts. He's got stuff that's going to get swing and misses here. Not just at AAA but but in the major leagues. And if you're ahead big league hitters are going to chase. He's got the Wipeout slider especially the right handed batters. It's a some crazy swing and miss numbers. So he lands that fastball kind of in on Geuri Uhl 97 miles an hour and he can go back to that. He can go to the slider and. Gurriel's got to respect that heater in and that velocity. 35% strikeout rate for Festa tops amongst all Triple-A starters with at least 50 innings thrown this season. Just missed on it away there and a two ball, one strike count. Foster in the rotation for the injured Chris Paddack. And now three and one Lourdes Gurriel Jr . Sam McWilliams, Walter Pennington and David Festa 13 strikeouts per nine. Behind three, one. And there's his first big league base runner. First major league walk. His burial is on here in the second. So the change that the twins coaching staff made with David last year was shifting him over to the third base side of the rubber, and that happened midway through the 2023 season. And after that change, it may seem subtle, but with his fastball, the amount of miss he was generating with that subtle movement perk over to the third base side, it went up significantly. They didn't just move him over a little bit. His heel is the only thing on the rubber right now. You see how his whole front of his foot is off. The rubber quickly hit back to the mound and Festa throws high when Santana needs to stretch a little bit to make that play. So Gurriel down to second and there are two down as McCarthy is retired. Some nerves here with this throw, I would say so a little bit. Maybe run that thing over and give it a little underhand flip. Yeah He's got to keep checking those firsts off the list. So two down. Here's Kevin Newman his first appearance in this series with the Reds last year. Long time Pittsburgh Pirate. Before that Newman was a first round pick by the Pirates in 2015. Hitting almost 390, his last 11 starts. And there's a slider. Misses high two balls and no strikes. There's number 58. He wore a much higher number than that in camp last Wynns wear 58. Dylan Floro last year. Popped up and playable this one near the rafters. It's going to be Lewis grabbing it. And Arizona leaves a runner in scoring position. David Festa has got plenty of family and friends. Andre Martin will be in the Festa section when we come back.ToTo cheer him on. Are 17 members of his family and friends. I'm sitting in between his parents. Peter, Debbie. Brother Chris. Guys, I can only imagine how the emotions have been the last couple of days. Dad, I'll start with you. What was it like when you got the news that your son was about to have his dream come true? That's. That's just it. His dream is coming true. And it's. It was unbelievable. Draining. But it was great. And it's just a culmination, as you know, of a lot of hard work. And mom speaking of the hard work, what have you seen from him over the years that has allowed him to have the success, allowed him to be here in this moment? I think he's always had this dream, and he has always said from a very young boy that one day he will play Major League Baseball. And I think his his really good, hard work ethic and he never he never turns away. So inside and dad, I know you were pacing during the first inning. Have the nerves subsided? A little bit. No, no, but a very good start. A very good start. Yes, yes. For sure. And guys, I heard that you guys are just finding out about the Slim Reaper nickname for the first time today. Chris, what do you think about the nickname? I personally love it. I know mom doesn't like it too much, but you know, it's building a brand and hopefully it takes off because I personally love it. He gets a good laugh out of it, so I want to see it blow up. And mom, I know we cannot predict the future, but how excited are you to see what he will be able to still accomplish as he takes advantage of this opportunity? I just love it. I think for him the sky's the limit and he just has to keep living the dream, working hard, staying true to himself and the rest will fall into place and definitely as twins fans are getting to know him, what is something about your son that you think twins fans should know? just that, you know, he he he was never he was a low draft pick. The twins gave him an opportunity, which we're really grateful for. And just goes to show you that any draft pick or any kid out there can have their dream come true, if they're willing to work for it. Absolutely. Well I will let you guys enjoy the rest of the game. Great start. Let's keep it going, right? Yes. And enjoy. And hopefully we'll see you guys. Many more games to come. Thank you so much. Thank you for your time. Of course. Thank you. You're welcome guys. Back up to you Oddanier. Great job and great to see so many of his family andrien here for his big league debut. And I thought the point there raised at the end by his father and his mother for that tter, that it's not guaranteed but certainly perk. You were a first round pick. You know, David, a 13th round pick. No path is easy. But for a guy that was selected 399th overall in 2021, it's Noé Gimy that he's going to get here. The lower you get drafted, the more difficult it is, the harder you have to work to prove that you belong towards the whole. Perdomo sets up and Buxton beat it. He picks his spots infield hit the buck truck still makes an appearance and the lead off man is on once again. Bayron is two for two. Speed doesn't slump, and Byron Buxton smelled a hit as soon as he made contact. And that should be a routine play. And he didn't just beat that out, he beat that out by a step. That's crazy. No, but and credit Festa for how hard he has worked and the commitment that he made to the organization. And they laid out a plan for him when they drafted him. I mentioned at the beginning of the of the game he was a he was a guy that threw upper 80s and really took to the developmental plan that the twins laid out for him to build velocity to gain flexibility. And he's still developing to left center. And the gap. Willie Castro another extra base hit Byron Buxton. He is flying around third base. He scores. Castro is going to try for third. He'll make it standing. It's an RBI triple and the twins are pouring it on today. It's seven. Nothing. Second base I got a lot of joy listening to David Festa's parents talk about him and his journey, and something else that gives me a lot of joy is watching Byron Buxton run like this. To see him healthy, running, flying the way that he did. Willie Castro right on his heels. Makes for some exciting baseball. When these guys are able to do what they do. His fifth triple and Castro now with a ten game hitting streak. He's two for two today as farmer swings and misses. And during this ten game hitting streak alone for Castro it hasn't been just all singles. If you break it down he's got two homers, eight doubles, a couple of triples. During this run. He's been on offensively. Infield about halfway and farmers off right now continues to chase. It's zero and two. The Buxton speed on display here beating out an infield hit. And scoring with ease on Castro's triple. The Diamondbacks now activate their bullpen. Farmer chased that one last inning. Doesn't do it here. And it's 1 and 2. Montgomery had momentum leading up to the start today. His prior three. His ERA was in the high twos. And Scott Mcguff from the twins saw last night for an inning. He was warming up again. This one up the middle and Castro will hold as Perdomo makes the play and throws out farmer. So one out, one on one in. Let's step aside and hear this message from the Minnesota Lottery. Play today for a chance to win $100,000 chum. And well, Margot with an RBI hit back in the six run second six runs. By the way last inning only two earned. You mentioned earlier, Burke, about Montgomery signing very late. He signed in fact, after the season already started. March 29th, Blake Snell signed with the Giants ten days earlier and both Montgomery and Snell, when reflecting back on their off season, stretched and stressed. I should say, the importance of spring training, something that neither had with their respective teams Snell, the Giants nor Montgomery with Arizona for veteran guys, spring training always seems like a formality, going through the motions just getting ready for the season. Like it doesn't really matter until you don't have one. And it's not just guys that sign late. It's guys that miss chunks of spring training lined to left. Gurriel jumps up, makes the catch, but Castro will tag and score and it's eight. Nothing. Second RBI for Margot today. You don't realize how important spring training is until you don't have one. And I'm sure there's guys that haven't had spring training that do okay, but by and large, when you miss that time in that opportunity to build up your body and your arm, you end up, you end up behind and that's the case with Snell. And that's the case. I mean, you can look at everything that Montgomery did last year and what he's doing this year. He's not doing anything even as good as he did last year. Everything has dropped back and it's very easy to point to. You didn't have spring training. Gray has been on twice, single and a run, and he was in take mode. There Ball two. Even when there's not adrenaline in spring training, you can't simulate pitching in games facing big league hitters, even things as simple as just covering first base, running around, doing your PhD, all of those things that gets you ready for a season. There's no way to simulate that outside of being in camp. Could be his final man. Three and zero on Correia. And it's a four pitch walk. And let's see if Torey Lovullo will stick with Montgomery, with Royce Lewis coming up and the answer will be no. Now, there have been times when Montgomery has been booed off of this mound, and it may happen again today. Signed a one year deal with vesting option for 2025, and for the second straight day of the twins chase the opposing starter and you bet. Here comes some boo birds here in the desert. Eight. Nothing. Still batting. Twins up here in the third inning.Here's Jordan Montgomery after he came out. That is his pitch com device. Not one, not two, but three. What did the pitch com ever do to him? Three. Hard chucks and his dugout. So he leaves. And Scott McGough is on early for the second straight game as Royce Lewis bounce for the third time. Lewis, an RBI and a run last inning, go for two and zero for his last 16. Sums this one is center field deep Corbin Carroll going back still going. And with one step on the track runs it down. But the twins had two more rubber game of this series. The lead is now eight.ToTo Early run support for David Festa. The twins are up eight. Nothing as he takes the mound in the bottom of the third. Still looking for his first strikeout. And ball one to Geraldo Perdomo. Festa has seen one over the minimum so far. The only base runner was a walk last inning and a ground ball. And this one, played by Farmer and Perdomo, hustling. But his retired one out now this year in the minor leagues, David Festa classified more as a fly ball pitcher. He doesn't throw a sinker. Seeing a few on the ground here in his big league debut. For ground balls. So far, seven outs, a couple of harmless fly balls, one pop up switch hitting catcher Jose Herrera. So Tucker Barnhart behind the plate the first couple of days and now Herrera his first start today. Arizona missing its starting catcher Gabriel Moreno who's on the I.L. With finger injury. And the Diamondbacks they're going to get healthier including this weekend Arizona stays home. The A's are here for a weekend series and the Diamondbacks expecting to have Zac Gallen back in the rotation maybe as early as Saturday. Outfielder Alec Thomas He should be back this weekend as well. One and two Juan Herrera and all time. Santana, as he often does, makes the play himself for out number two. Seby Mordan a few years back, the twins. In the off season, they ditched the idea of having fall instructional league, instead opting to have specialized camps and mainly for pitchers and different camps for different guys in terms of what they threw. And we'll get back to that when Festa is back on the mound next inning. But a one, two, three third, he's rolling and so is the offense. Eight. Nothing. Labaut the.Register now for the twins girls baseball camp at CHS field. There's three days of baseball fun. July 16th through the 18th. Sign up and play right now at play ball n com. Eight nothing. Twins It was 4 or 5 and six against Scott Mcguff as Miranda. Takes high ball one random one for one with a sac fly RBI. Has eight extra base hits over his last 18 games. Reynardo. That swing. But now 2 and 1. Miranda joined Aldrem after the game last night. And just enjoying the opportunity to be healthy and seeing regular playing time. And when Royce Lewis came back. Well, the twins , remember roster wise, were in a tough spot. The cleaner move would have been to send Miranda down with Eddie Julian at second base. But you know, it's a tough call. But they stuck with the guy that was playing better, and Miranda pretty much won that last game at Houston. Yeah, I think there was a handful of things working against Miranda, but he caught fire at the right time. I think position wise, it was easier to have Julian having the left handed bat, but Miranda was just hitting the ball too well, and that's kind of what he's always been, is a guy that's going to hit his way into the lineup. He's going to force his way into the lineup with his bat. He did that two years ago. And also would you say two improvement defensively. Third base. Well, and I think that the expectations for him defensively this year were essentially none. He didn't play much third base in spring training. Really couldn't throw yet. But he's looked fantastic over there as well. Rocco often says when putting together his lineup, it's a good problem to have when you have your nine spots, but you can make a case for about an additional 1 or 2 guys that should be in there on a given day. And that is called low ball four. So Miranda NESN, the lead off man, is on for the third straight inning. And here comes Carlos Santana. Let's take a look as we go in the driver's seat. Brought to you by Hyundai. The twins hitters five through nine. Look at where they rank on base percentage. OPS extra base hits today, that group is a combined six for ten. And that's a balanced offense as this one caught a piece of Herrera more than a piece, more like a chunk. Well, Carlos Santana, the way he's been going, is it his last 20? He's got 11 extra base hits, 12 now with his double today Castro the triple. The lineup gets really deep really quick. And throw a buck in the mix too. The way he's swinging the bat, the way he's running this group today has scored five of the eight runs Miranda hit eighth last night well. And Willie Castro is hitting eighth today. And he's been the leadoff guy when there's a righty on the mound. Uvila feel comfortable enough to drop him all the way down. That's a guy that you say he can. He can get the most at bats for us as a left handed hitter, he's been hitting really well as a Reyden and we can put him all the way down there. Just really stretches the lineup out. First at bat for Santana, hitting left handed. And Carlos told us yesterday in terms of hitting righty hitting lefty doesn't change the bat in terms of weight measurement, but he does change in terms of color, has a different colored bat from the right side as opposed to his left handed swing. I was surprised when he told us that it's the same bat. I feel like every other switch hitter that I've talked to uses a lighter bat from one side or the other, depending on where they feel stronger from. But he must color code him so he doesn't, I don't know, grab the wrong one, but they're the same full count to Santana, who has an RBI double today. I guess it doesn't have to make sense. It works. You know. Santana did say as the season moves along, he will not always but often shift to a lighter in terms of weight, a lighter bat as the season plays out, tired hands. One out. Nobody out. And that strike three on the corner. Santana strikes out, looking first out here in the twins. Fourth. Carlos was right. That ball was inside. That guy knows the strike zone. Ryan Jeffers one for two. Right Men seeking their 45th win. And their second straight winning series on this three city road trip. Twins head to Seattle against the first place Mariners starting tomorrow night .Kubatko the twins dugout having some fun here. Juan Miranda to run. That's Vázquez telling him that wheels himself. And Miranda has one stolen base. And the guy that's chirping with him, Cristian Vázquez. He has two. He had his third yesterday when Castro struck out to end the inning. Vázquez caught last night, and Jeffers today.The twins have had some at bats in this series, and we're seeing it right now from Jeffers. Some lengthy at bats in terms of foul balls and thinking back the last couple of years, the good teams, the better teams, the better offensive teams. In baseball, you just see that more often. They grind you down, grind it every Macguffins thrown 22 pitches this inning and got one out. That's his 23rd pitch of this inning. He's got a walk and a strikeout looking. That should have been another walk. Ryan Jeffers has seen eight pitches in this At-Bat. Guff through anJeffers has seen eight pitches innings At-Bat. Guff through anJeffers has seen eight pitches inning At-Bat. Guff through anJeffers has seen eight pitches inning last at. Guff through anJeffers has seen eight pitches inning last nightuff through anJeffers has seen eight pitches inning last night. f through anJeffers has seen eight pitches inning last night. Struck gh anJeffers has seen eight pitches inning last night. Struck outan two allowed, one run. Jeffers checks swing as it ran inside and did not go. And a full count. It's hard to hold up when you're trying to get out of the way of the pitch. At the same time, but he's going full now in all three batters. Mcguff has this inning, and Jeffers takes a second walk. Of the inning. And now Byron Buxton, who's been on twice. Two singles, two runs.Over there. That's pulled foul. Twins put up eight runs. Last night. And an eight three win lost, five four in the opener. And Arizona really entering the series among the better teams in baseball here in the month of June 14th. Wins this month. They came in to this series playing well especially here at home. Brought their bats to Arizona and the four runs on Friday. Was that Friday? What day is today? Thursday. Today is Tuesday. Tuesday. They're all the days of the same quarry. On Tuesday it was a laser show. They just there was Adam Balls. They could have put up eight on Tuesday. Do the days I mean you don't. You never played. But when you're in this life and following this sport, it's hard to keep track of the days. The three city trips. Yes. Especially night games. Day game. Could be a Sunday. Could be a Thursday. You never know. Fourth batter this inning and all four now have run the count full walk to Miranda. Santana struck out looking. Jeffers walked and Bayron doesn't walk too often. He swings and launches left center and deep Bec it goes and gone. Slightly left of dead center tape measure blast for Byron Buxton. Man, this offense is rolling. It's 11. Nothing here in Phoenix. Wow. You got to hit it far and you got to hit it high to get out of center field. At this ballpark. And he got on top of a four seam fastball. Outside corner extension. Holy cow. 456ft. The center fielders at this ballpark play shallow because that that that wall out there, the ricochet comes off really far. And Corbin Carroll took like two steps. And that ball was already over his head. Oh my gosh. The balance up and down this lineup and this team has health. They don't chase. And we've seen games like this often here in the month of June. Another double digit run scoring output. And we're only in the fourth inning homers and 16 straight now for the twins as well. And 27 overall perk in that 16 game run and Castro to right but playable for McCarthy. And that was out number two as Willie's retired for the first time today. Second base Dionmy Marman. Kyle Farmer is the only twin yet to reach somehow, some way today. Zero for two. Jagers Arizona activates his bullpen. Bryce Jarvis, whom we saw late yesterday, is up again. The only length that Arizona received from any reliever last night Remember, the starter, Ryan Nelson, did not get through four innings? Was Tiago Vieira. He went two and a third. But everybody else who was pretty much one inning. Yeah Well all those guys are going to be pitching again today. A position player at some point. Two one count to farmer. Farmer got a piece of that. This game has been going for, like, an hour and 20 minutes. I think David Festa has been on the mound for about five minutes. 41st pitch of the inning, and it would be a 42nd. Spent more time walking around in the dugout than he has pitching him out. There he is. So Audra spoke with David's parents earlier, and we see David pacing up and down. And this is what he does, by the way, this is not just today, and he's not one to sit when he starts and farmer strikes out looking inning over. But the twins add three more and Byron Buxton didome damage here in the desert. 456ft 11. Nothing.Yeah.Let's get you caught up. Thanks to our friends with Toyota. The twins offense erupting early. A six run second, and the twins have added on in a big way. Two more in the third. Byron Buxton, a moment ago, his third hit, a three run homer and David Festa in his big league debut. Three innings, no hits, a walk, no strikeouts as he starts the fourth with an 11 nothing lead. A thing I would imagine you did not enjoy your big league debut at Fenway Park. I didn't have an 11 run lead, if that's what you're saying. You don't remember anything? I don't remember anything. I don't know what the score was. It was like the sixth or the seventh inning. Everything is moving. So fast. But you did tell the story earlier this season about your first big league strikeout. Yeah. What happened with that baseball? That's foul 3 and 2. It's I mean it's long since been had the cover chewed off by a dog. It ended up in the stands behind the. We were in the third base dugout and it's it ended up up there somewhere. Some fan got it, brought it home, gave it to their kid. Their kid gave it to the dog. The dog ate it. So it's not at my house because the catcher at the time, who's going into the Hall of Fame power. Pretty soon was unaware. Hey. Well, the right center field this one carrying back to the wall and gone home run to tell Marty his 17th in the first run given up by Festa is a home run. Second home run of the series for Marty, both from the left side. Towards the pool and Marty is second home run in this series. It went into the pool section. I don't know if it went in the pool. I think it was a changeup. Yep Kind of just drifted out over the middle, see if this thing gets in the pool. Over the fans heads. See a splash back there that looks like bigger than a baseball splash. Joc Pederson, who grounded out his first time up. And there's 96 for a strike. I want to get back to Festa. And something that the twins changed with their off season programing a couple of years ago. Perk about ditching your typical fall instructional league idea, but really focusing more on specialized camps and specialized programs for certain pitchers and among them, the twins brought a Top Gun camp, a high velo improved Velo camp, and Festa has been part of that group, and that idea now for a couple of seasons. Yeah. And I think just strictly calling it Velo camp is a little bit misleading. That's the ultimate goal, is to take guys that they feel like have more velocity. And there's his first major league strikeout against a veteran, and Joc Pederson. And that baseball will not be chucked into the stands. Instead, it finds the twins dugout strikeout number one for David Festa. Congratulations to David Festa. That ball ended up in the hands of Tony Diaz. Went to an authenticator good slider out of the zone. Got a pretty good major league hitter to chase. Look at the first strikeout from her T-Mobile coverage cam, but it's more the ultimate goal is to build velocity. But but it's as much about building strength, leg strength, core strength. Getting these guys stronger, getting them to move more efficiently. And so there's a lot of things that go into it. It's not all just long toss, weighted ball work. It's more of a total body thing. And so they highlight guys that they feel like have something, which is really why a guy like David Festa gets drafted. We like his frame. He's tall, he's lanky. He's going to add some weight, but he's got the levers that they like and then it's just about maximizing them. But it's not going to work unless the guy that is doing it buys in and that's David Festa. He bought in and has picked up ten miles an hour in velocity since he signed another example of a guy who benefited from that off season programing. Lewys Varland. Yep there's a couple more guys down further down in the minor leagues that that kind of those later draft picks you're mining. You know, it's not all about the top picks. You get some depth. You find some guys see if you can get them to throw harder. Lewys Varland a low pick. Zebbie Matthews is another guy down there. Lower draft pick and Walker strikes out. There's a righty righty changeup. So back to back. Punchouts two down following the home run to Martin. Starting to see him be a little bit more aggressive I think maybe that home run decided that was enough. And I like that right on right changeup. You come with three fastballs 96 and throw a changeup 89 at the bottom, falls out of so two down. And now Lourdes Gurriel Jr. He's buckled by that front door slider came into this inning with just two swing and misses. And he's got three so far. Just in this inning Two out single from Gurriel. And he's out for the second time. Best in the month of June at Triple-A. In four starts, he averaged 84 pitches per outing. And now Jake McCarthy. He grounded out two Festa and his only at bat. Not just the work that Festa did in Fort Myers, but also the new Jersey native was able to find a place to work out and a place to work on his craft in the off season, and the twins helped him out in finding a location to focus in on certain elements of his game. And credit to assistant GM Jeremy Zoll for helping out. Finding a good area for David to work out in his hometown of Verona, new Jersey. I think that's underrated because guys, after the season go home and have much less contact with their teams, and there's no face to face contact and you have the option to go down to Florida. There's always people there at the complex, but for guys that want to be home in the off season to have the assistance, I think is invaluable. So right field and shallow and Margot will play this on a bounce and Gurriel will make third. Yeah Margot looked to be a bit indecisive with a ten run lead. You dive and try to make the play or just limit this to a single. I think he keeps running. That's. I think he could have made that play if he kept running after that ball hung up, he kind of pulled up second early. That's what we like to see him go make that play. Jeferson Karinchak with Festa. And before Newman bats, let's step out for this word from Kwik Trip. Cool off your summer with a Coca-Cola summer cash grab and Kwik Trip play daily to enter to win up to $250,000. No purchase necessary. See Kwik Trip Comm slash sweepstakes for details. So one in, two on two out and Kevin Newman popped out his first time. Infesta two was not on the 40 man roster. Does that play into it as well? About where a guy can yeah, go? Once guys are on the roster, you can't require them to come down to Florida. So the Top Gun camp, the Velo camps, those things that they do. That's all for non roster guys. Once you're on the roster then players are on their own. It's a right down the line. Slicing fell. But you know as I know growing up in Minnesota spending my off seasons in Minnesota David Festa out on the East Coast, it's a little more difficult than it is for guys in southern California, guys in Texas, Florida, those kind of places. You don't have the same kind of options. So I think it's awesome that they're they're assisting players and finding facilities close to home that that meet the standards that they're looking for. Oh, and two, on the Arizona third baseman runner at first goes to right down the line, slicing in the corner and landing. Fell As McCarthy took off, Newman will head back still. Oh, and two David Festa was not really a pitcher in high school until his senior year. He was committed to play shortstop at a Division three school, and then, because of injury his junior year during a state tournament, they needed some help on the mound and Festa stepped up, pitched well and then became part of the pitching plans. His senior year before walking on at Seton Hall. Again, the oh two pitch fastball fouled back. Wandi, 22 pitches this inning and seven a pitch third, trying to put Newman away. Base hit into left and it's 11 two. Three straight hits as this Arizona forth continues. Ahead oh two. He just couldn't put him away with the breaking ball. He got it away. But probably not down quite enough. Nice piece of hitting from Newman. Five pitches that at bat to Newman. Everything was somewhat in the zone. So now Geraldo Perdomo switch hitting shortstop, takes high. He went. He's set to left. McCarthy has the green light. Castro is going to fire towards the plate, and it's not in time. So four straight hits, all singles, but Arizona has scored three and some noise here inside Chase field for the first time today. Willmert started this inning off with a home run on a changeup. And then it's been short little swings, line drives, ground balls through the infield. Hits going the other way. So Pete Mahki out for mound. Visit. And the twins have some action now in their bullpen as Fest is out. 62 pitches. He's a key guy right now and Jose Herrera, switch hitting catcher Caleb Thielbar is now warming up the lineup about to turn over. Lawlar up in three big league games this season. Is zero for four. His 91st career big league game. He's a 195 hitter. Ball one. To left, center and down a base hit. Another run will score. Newman is in. Perdomo goes to third safely. And it's 11 four. Five straight hits. And now we'll see what Rocco Baldelli will do with left handed hitting Corbin Carroll coming up and Arizona is one swing away from finding itself right back in this game. Yeah. You got to be careful here now too. As the lineup turns over for a third time I thought that might have been it for Festa, but I think it will be. I think Jeffers might be out here to take up some time. Try to stall as much as they can. I Tonkel does look like he's going anywhere too fast right now. Festa. Staying in to see the National League Rookie of the year last season. Carroll has bounced out twice to Kyle Farmer. Behind two and zero. Here's strike one. I've been pitching Carroll up in there all series long. Popped up. Lewis drifting out, and the iing ends there. But Arizona brings nine to the plate and scores four.InIn.This part of the fun I was going to say. I don't think. You can see you'll be able to see the ice cream residue on my chin. That's okay. Can I ask why? Why desert? Like what led you down the desert path today? Well, every ballpark, you know, I check out their new items to see what they have going. And I tend to pick the craziest one. I'll be honest, the Diamondbacks didn't have a whole lot of really out there options. This was something that I had never seen at a ballpark, so I decided to go with it. And you know, sometimes who doesn't like to eat dessert before you eat. This is amazing. It is really good. This is really, really good. One ball, one strike on Carlos Correa. Not a big dessert guy. Ball two. You would you you had what'd you have in San Francisco. You had something that night. We had a little Italian cheesecake. Cheesecake I do like cheesecake. And that was not a small piece of cheesecake. No, it was, it was it was a hearty portion, a hearty slice. I do like cheesecake. The other thing I wanted to mention, guys, we saw the home run there land by the pool. I'm obviously disappointed that I was at the pool yesterday, not today, but I was on the bus this morning chatting with Carlos Correa and he was asking about my experience out in the pool, and I told him that no twin has ever hit a home run out there. He was like, I would love to help you out. He's like, I'm not your guy. And he pointed over to Carlos Santana. He goes, that's your guy. And Carlos took his headphones off and he was like, what are you guys talking about? And Correa told him, no one's ever hit one out there. And he goes, I got you today. I got you. So I think Santana maybe a little extra motivated. How sweet would that be? If he calls his own shot? He's my pick. I think Trevor Larnach and him are the two most likeliest for me, but I think Larnach, if he gets one, it's going to go over it. And so I think Carlos that's right in his wheelhouse, love to see it. Correa draws a walk and that moves Margot down to second. And here comes Royce Lewis. So we've had a few bites now it's getting better. Aldry all right. It is. It's so good okay. This is so good. It's very melty okay. Which is my fault. It is 115 degrees outside. But it is so good. It is really good. Louis with a bullet to left. Gurriel can't make the play. He missed it. Margot will score. Correa to third base and Louis winds up at second base. And the zero for 17 is over. RBI for double Royce Gurriel did not make a good read initially. It was hit hard, kept on going and the twins lead grows back to eight. It's hard to read. Balls hit right at you when you're in center and it can happen in left as well. It can happen in right. And that ball was absolutely scorched by Royce Lewis and he doesn't do slumps. But he was in a little bit of a slump there. He needed that he said to hitting coach David Hopkins I don't do the slump thing. Over 17 is now over Miranda deep to center Corbin Carroll will have a play. Correa will tag and score Lewis to third and his 13 to 4. What do they call this thing? An apple pie chimichanga? I was going to say it tastes a lot like apple pie. Yeah that's checks out. It's yeah. Apple pie. It's good. It's in a burrito. Flash fried I would say. Anybody at home who makes apple pie like for Thanksgiving or Christmas, try tossing a couple Cracker Jacks on there because it adds a nice little pop of flavor. Good crunch. You are inhaling that, my friend? Yeah, this is good. Well, here's your here's your guy. Here's your pick Carlos Santana hitting left handed infield does come in with Lewis at third. Santana with an RBI double today and takes a strike. You know the 4th of July is coming up. And 4th of July you're with family friends and ice cream certainly is a part of 4th of July celebration. And Aldry going to have you give this read here about what's happening at Target Field here. 4th of July week upcoming with the twins are back home starting on Tuesday. So mixing baseball and ice cream. Go ahead. I'm going to do my best. Corey Erovis impression Gau celebrate the 4th of July week by taking in a twins game at Target Field. The MLB ballpark app is your place to buy and manage tickets to the six game homestand that features the Detroit Tigers and the Houston Astros. Download the MLB ballpark app today. Well done, well done. Off the charts enthusiasm. So good. The pool is waiting. Can Santana deliver? Went that way. But to shallow right and McCarthy in and Lewis will hold two down. With the twins scoring two runs, the lead back up to nine. In terms of the twins bullpen saw Caleb Thielbar warming it up when Arizona was batting in the fourth inning, and right now it is quiet, hoping that Festa can get through the fifth and qualify for a win in his big league debut. I think the fact that they let him face Carroll a pretty good sign that they were going to let him try to get through the fifth and Thielbar might have been warming up for Joc Pederson. That might have been the At-Bat that they had targeted for him. Ryan Jeffers has been on twice a A walk, two runs scored, took a big cut. There on a Jarvis slider. You are showing no signs of slowing on that, are you, Glenn? No. This is going to. This is going to. I'm going to lick this tray clean. I'm glad I picked a good one to kick off one another season. You're one for one in season. Whatever this is. What did I call it? Audrey eats. Audrey eats stuff at ballparks. Like I said. Yeah I got a working title. I was told that I needed a workshop, something last night. You got a workshop? That. Okay. All right. Gardens, ballpark market worked out. You know, we got those catch with Audrey segments. It's not the most creative title either, but it works. So we might just need to say stick with us. That's the best. Right Audrey eats food and Perdomo throws out Jeffers and the inning ends. Twins add 213 for David Festa coming back out for the fifth.He's a man of the people. And a man that keeps his word. And in between innings. Nothing left. The chimichanga. Ice cream bowl history. Glenn Perkins, one. Chimichurri. Chimichanga. Whatever it is. Right. Apple pie. Zero. Ketel Marte again to right center. Buxton will drift. And that's in play. And Bayron awkwardly stumbled. But will pop up and get it back in as Marte doubles to begin the fifth inning. Bayron checking his landing spot. It's almost 413. Just right at that 413 sign right of dead center. So a leadoff double for Marte. Eugenio Suarez hit one out there on Tuesday night. That one right at the base of the wall. You don't need but colliding with the wall right now. Here's Joc Pederson zero for two. To center this one playable for Buxton. Marte will tag catch is made and there is out number one. And the twins once again activate their bullpen. It was a lefty and Thielbar that was warming last inning. And now it's right at Cole Sands here in the fifth. The Festa must get through this inning to qualify for the win, and the twins will concede the run infield back, with Christian Walker coming up.Festa A top 100 prospect in the game. To third and Lewis on the short hop will let the run score and a good throw. And Walker's retired two down as Marte scores the fifth Arizona run. Escotto Landinez. O'Hoppe Gimy. Teudis. Lourdes Gurriel Jr has been on twice walk a single and a run.Just missed. One and two. With Perdigon. The AL and Festa lined up to pitch. Next at home against Detroit. And if given that chance, first time that he'll get the opportunity in between starts. In between games to work with Pete Machín, the twins pitching team to gear up for it could be his second start. Maybe fall into a little routine, slow things down a little bit. Just get settled in. It's so chaotic. I think he flew out here maybe yesterday. I don't know if he got out here the day before. I don't think so. So everything is spinning. It's a foul ball. Jeffers could not hang on to it. And this 2-2 count continues to Gurriel.Jumped over the mound. Kyle Farmer will make the play and David Festa works through five in line for his first major league win.David. Festa Five innings lined for the win. Shaking hands with Rocco Baldelli. He did arrive from Des Moines, Iowa. Here last night around 7:00 and looks like his day is over. And now Buxton is hit by a pitch after reaching three times, gets hit by a fastball up and inside. And he will take his base. Elbow guard. I don't think that's. That feels good. Even though you got an elbow guard on. And now the dialog begins. The breakdown with his pitching coach. Willie Castro, two for three today. A triple A single. He has scored twice, has an RBI. Double We know that every team, in terms of the all star game has to have one representative. Is this guy building a case to be in Arlington next month? I think when you factor in that, that he can play multiple positions, it's going to benefit him. I think the other the other one, Joe Ryan's got a case, Carlos Correa. But shortstop has never been deeper and he's certainly made a push. But I think I honestly would not be surprised if it was Willie Castro. He's got the numbers. There's no question in my mind he would fit, and I don't think it would be to this guy, end up here. He's put together an all star first half. You know we know it. But I think nationally if a casual fan who doesn't follow the twins sees the name Willie Castro, they're going to say like? Yes. What? But then if they look at the resume, you know, it should tell them it's a foul ball. Ball was on the ground still 1 and 2 on Castro that he's deserving. I would imagine his his name in baseball circles, you know, among teams. People know who they know who he is. Opposing managers opposing teams. They're preparing for Willie Castro. He's he's got other teams on notice. There's no way that he doesn't. Second for one, no return. As Buxton is forced out as Castro is on with the fielder's choice. So one away here in the sixth. Twins have an eight run lead. Now word from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety ten miles an hour over the speed limit, 15 over 20 over. It just might put you six feet under. A message from the Minnesota Department of Public Safety, the only twin yet to reach is Kyle Farmer. Zero for three, two strikeouts.Farmer to right center. And Jake McCarthy makes the play for out number two. As Castro remains at first. And here's Manuel. Margot, who's been on twice, two singles. He's knocked in two and scored two of the 13 runs.Caleb Thielbar back up in the twins bullpen. Looks like he will come in for the home sixth. As Margot is behind two strikes. Pomares Thielbar. He was warming up in the fourth. And lefty Jake McCarthy set to lead off the Arizona sixth. Knocked down by Herrera and Castro. Stays put. I'm not a big fan of the idea that every team has to send one, and just never been a big proponent of that idea. Yeah, I'm with you. I think that that maybe goes back to when not every game was on TV, and then you could put every uniform, you know, get, get representation. But now you see people everywhere again in the hall. Perdomo long throw and it's in time and a good play by Geraldo Perdomo in the hole at short and Margot is out. Number three. And the twins will not challenge. And we'll play on.The twins. Baseball on Bally Sports is brought to you by Chevrolet. The number one selling brand in the Twin Cities . The final game of this series, David Festa's big league debut is or. When five five runs, seven hits a walk. He struck out two just shy of 80 pitches. Purke in his big league debut. Yeah, and the line doesn't look great. It was one bad inning and five straight singles, but I think all in all you take that outing. I think that inning could have been different and not hard contact against vested today. The average exit below below league average. Caleb Thielbar in to see Jake McCarthy and he flies out to Byron Buxton for the first out. I think if there's any play that the twins could have a redo of in the fourth inning defensively was the McCarthy two on base hit to right where it looked like Manuel Margot. If he keeps on running two outs in the inning you have a ten run lead. Maybe you go after that a bit more. Completely changes the perspective on the outing, at least the final numbers. I think he ends up out of that inning with just the solo homer from Marte, and then who knows? You're facing the bottom of the lineup. Clean inning in the fifth, and I take my chances that he gets through that. Not by giving up five straight singles or three more singles after that. McCarthy one could have been different, but I think he can walk away proud of the job that he did today. Lots of positive signs, something to build on and really, most importantly, just getting the first one out of the way and just just being done with that. And now you're a major leaguer and you can go about your daily routines, work on what you need to work on in beten, and ke a k again andack at Target Field. How much will a guy like Festa lean on? Pablo López or Joe Ryan or Bailey Yilber before his next start? Or is it up to those veteran, more veteran players to seek David Festa? I would imagine that they'll go talk to him about the outing. I don't know why they wouldn't and tell him what they saw, what they thought he did. Well, I think for Festa, if I'm him, I'm going to go watch those guys throw their bullpens and just see how they go about their business. Louis throws that one away. Royce just a little too casual as that ball was finding him at third base. And Santana never had a chance. And another throwing error charged to Royce Lewis here in the sixth inning. Statcast 3D is powered by Google Cloud. Look at the outs today. Recorded by David Festa. The off speed stuff plays. His fastball obviously plays, but the changeup sliders that he threw today I talked to Pete McKee before the game. Just what can we expect kind of mix wise. And he said his guess would have been right around 33, 33, 33 with those three pitches. Threw a few more fastballs than he did changeups. He threw 33% sliders, just over 40, four seamers, 24% changeups. And but to be able to throw off speed stuff in the zone, to get ahead and to get yourself back in a count is something that he was able to do today. One ball, one strike on Geraldo Perdomo and missed most of the first half with an injured right knee. This is only his 20th game of the year. Festa threw his slider in the strike zone. 62% of the time. Got four swing and misses on it. Average exit Velo 81. That's really good. Aro foul on a two. Haylen Thielbar hasn't thrown in a week, and last time he threw was at Target Field against Tampa Bay. Two thirds scoreless with a hit and a strikeout. Newman, at first. This one shot to short Correia will play the high hop and quickly fired a seat in time to get Perdomo two down as farmer enjoyed that perspective. I enjoyed our perspective. That's fun to watch. High chopper off of home plate. 3-0 Thwaits back on it knowing he's got that. Just a peat of first base. Two down and now Jose Herrera is that slow curveball from Thielbar. That's been a key pitch for Caleb Luilly going back to 2020.The twins have had some lopsided leads here since the one run loss in Oakland on Friday, then lost by one here on Tuesday. And it's odd how it goes, but there are stretches where the bullpen has been used heavily, and there are stretches when the guys haven't thrown too often. Underused, overused, right? It's rare to be in the middle .... You're never in the middle. You're just not. You're going to throw four times in a week, and then you're not going to throw for a week. No bullpen guys ever get to work like every other day. And then maybe two days off. You're either gassed or you're sitting down there hoping for a close game so you can pitch again. Ground ball well played by Thielbar. Good athlete and Santana with the catch and the step. Inning ends there. Diamondbacks lead one.Popped up.Let's take a look at our health partner. Sports update. Unique day yesterday in Milwaukee as the Brewers swept the Rangers fourth team in the last 70 years. With an inside the park home run, a grand slam and a walk off hit in the same game. Andrew Monastario won it. Jake Bauers a grand slam Jacson Suriel inside the park. Home run fourth team in the last 70 seasons to do that in the same game among the four. By the way, 1956 Pittsburgh Pirates Roberto Clemente did all three. Did you see where the inside the park home run was? I did not, and now Correa gets hit. Oh, not there, not there. And he's shaking his head side to side. And this is awful news here. And Correa he's coming right out. No good news here. He knew right away yeah it got him on the forearm bone. Right below the wrist. Noé don't like to see that. Huge run up in the Cardinals. Great game, 82. Almost shaking his head side to side. Or just not even making a fist with his right hand. And Austin Martin comes in to run. So that's a sour sight as the twins lead by eight late. Ball one to Royce Lewis, who has knocked in two runs today.Double play ball to short. And there were two down. And now, Jose Miranda. Before that hit by pitch, I was wondering where in Milwaukee you could hit a ball that would turn into an inside the park home run. It's a standard outfield fence. It's a not a huge park. Is there? Somewhere along that wall you could get, like, a funny deflection. There was a game between the twins and the Brewers, I believe the Milwaukee batter picked up an inside the park home run. I forgot who the twins outfielder was. I think he got hurt. Kind of got his foot pinned up against the wall and left. Maybe around 2010. I was only half listening right now. I don't know why. I was looking at the outfield fence here. It was against the twins. It was against Delmon young was Delmon young. That's a delmon young. And there was an inside the park home run, maybe Yuniesky Betancourt from Milwaukee was the hitter when that happens. So perhaps 2011. But that was when Delmon got hurt, right? Yeah. They had the left field. They had to like borderline, put him in an ambulance to get him off the field. And we all wondering if he was going to be okay out in the bullpen. And then he was just at his locker after the game, standing there doing an interview. Yeah. He got tangled up in the chain link in left field. So it has to be something like that. Like a, you know, like you look around here and the corners, the ball can bounce funny big, big alleys here. Huge ballpark center field wall. If you get a deflection. There's a lot of places at this field that could help you with an inside the park home run. Just Milwaukee. Miranda to short. And that's a clean catch made by Perdomo in the air. And the inning is over. But the twins lose. Carlos Correa will try to get an update as we move along here late today.Hey. 13. Five. Twins. Bottom seven. Caleb Thielbar. Back out. Speaking of the twins bullpen, let's take a look at our Rolaids relief stats. We're talking about last inning. Fewest innings thrown by any bullpen since June 20th. The twins lead the way. Kansas City, Atlanta, Texas. In that quartet. There's Bailey Ober complete game on Saturday Pablo went eight. That helps on Sunday. Quiet And now in that pen Carol down. Oh and two. Carroll has bounced out twice and popped out. He's a breaking ball. Drops low. The ball one. National League rookie of the year last year Corbin Carroll had an outstanding postseason as well. His numbers climbing a bit here in June. Career. Leaving the game Kyle Farmer is now playing short, so Austin Martin in left and Willie Castro moves to second. And Willie Castro will throw out Carroll. Third time in four at bats that Carroll has grounded out to the second baseman. Roger Martin is checking on Carlos Correa. And if and when we get an update, we'll certainly pass that along to you. Sanders. Cole Sands just got up in the bullpen during that Carroll at bat, and Rocco will make a move here to give Sands some time in the seventh inning today. So Thielbar good outing today. He departs twins by eight here in the seventh.For a win in his major league debut. Got plenty of run support, but got through five as we look at his day. Taking that to the bank. Brought to you by old nationals. Eight outs on the ground. A couple of strikeouts, handful of swing and misses, 14 out of 23 first pitch strikes. He had to deal with the delays early in the game. He got too much run support. He was able to fight through that. Got one more thing that he'll get to check off the list in just a little bit. That first major league win, Blaise Alexander is pinch hitting for Ketel Marte with Cole Sands on and a one ball, one strike count. First look at Alexander in this series, hitting 270 and 54 games. He's a rookie. And fired the twins dugout right side. Alexander's played around a little bit. Starts at second third short some DH. How fast is he. He blazes. That's what I was looking for down the line.HeHe really does. Whether speaking of his speed, he looks like an athlete. Sprint speed. He's in the 87th percentile. So if you have that name right. High 20s, high 28 something, 28, seven feet covered per second. 11th round pick by Arizona in 2018. And a blazing fastball from Cole Sands for out number two. McKinven 8-7 Cole Sands has picked up some velocity. This year. Seeing him higher than that. But with his carry on that fastball 96, it will get on the hitter. There's 92 on a cutter. That eats up Peterson Uhl for three today. One for ten in this series, Sands wasn't guaranteed a roster spot. An opening day, some injuries to his bullpen to start the year, and Cole was on the opening Day roster and had a great start to his season. His April numbers were fantastic. ERA in the low ones, numbers climbed for Sands in May. Here in June, though, before today and nine games is June ERA in the low threes. This is popped up and playable near the mound. It'll be Lewis making the play and the inning ends there we go to the eighth. Twins lead is eight.It's time to take a look at our green casino. Story of the game. Big day again. Offensively for the twins. 13 runs on 12 hits. Byron Buxton staying hot with the three for three effort, including a huge 456 foot home run. It was a three run blast. Willie Castro, also with another great day at the plate. He's got a AAA couple of hits here this afternoon. Now sitting on a nine game hit streak. And unfortunately right now the big news of the game Carlos Correa leaving after taking a pitch in the forearm back in the seventh inning. Guys so far I have not heard an update, but I certainly will keep you posted as soon as I do. Roger thank you. Swinging a downer and what has been an exciting day here in the rubber game of this series. 13 five Carlos Santana one for four today. Justin Martínez now pitching for Arizona and Santana rips a leadoff single into left field. The twins again put the leadoff man on. The leadoff man has been on in every inning since the first. My scorecard is such a mess that I was trying to follow along with you and yeah, so you put up 13 runs innings two through eight. The lead off man has been on in every inning, 13 runs on 13 hits. And now Jeffers could be two. Alexander Perdomo on to first. Two down Justin Martínez is a ground ball arm. He's a power arm. Recent podcast injured starter Zac Gallen was asked if there's any pitch you could take from any of your teammates. He said I would take Justin Martinez's fastball 100 mile an hour sinker. That gets ground balls at a 64% rate. Byron Buxton got hit on his elbow in the sixth inning. There's 102. He hasn't allowed a barrel yet. This year, and 28. Well, he might have Noé. Santana has probably hit two low 28 innings, 100 percentile and Darol 99th and hard hit 98th and ground ball. Up until this moment, twins had yet to see him in the series. He's a rookie. He's one on one high. Martínez debuted last year only ten games out of the 24th time here this season. Playable to left center and Carroll drifts over and there are two down. Make that three down. Cory lost track of how many outs there were double plays in the eighth inning that they do. Brand new. First day on the job. Popped up.What's up?Twins 13. Arizona five. Rubber game of this series. Summer is here. And that means it's time to celebrate in the land of 10,000 lakes. Be one of the first 5000 fans at Target Field on July fifth. To receive a Twin City Connect beach towel presented by Pentair as a twins com slash. Tickets for more information. Cody Funderburk got some family in town this week. His dad celebrated a birthday yesterday and is in town watching. His son has the ball here. Bottom eight today with an eight run lead and this is Tucker Barnhart batting in place of Christian Walker. And there's a strike. It's 1 and 1. Second appearance for Funderburk on this road trip. Second appearance since he's come back up from Triple-A. Second base Kleiver, 35, Strowd. One and two now on Barnhart. As the slider misses outside, 2 and 2. Everything about Cody Funderburk screams a guy that lefties should not be able to touch. That's a good pitch to not get the call with his breaking ball, the arm angle, kind of his delivery. He just doesn't locate as well to lefties as he has against righties. He's got really good stuff. I don't know if with a lefty up there, if it if it messes with his sight a little bit. No misfire there. So a leadoff walk to the pinch hitter Barnhart. He struggles locating that slider consistently to left handed batters. And that's been a little inconsistent, wouldn't you say? Not just Funderburk, whether it's been Thielbar Okert at times at all, some of these lefties have done against left handed hitters. Yeah, walk rate seems to be a bit on the higher side. And all three of those guys specifically for me, Okert and Funderburk should be able to carve up lefties. Lubo Bec of short that'll land. Gurriel as a multi-hit game. He had five straight multi-hit games entering the series, but picks up his first one against the twins here today on for the third time. The second base hit. Not an easy pitch to hit. It's just a matter of being able to locate that slider, getting it on the outside corner, and we'll see him do it occasionally, but more often we see him miss back either over the plate or yank them too far out of the zone away. And so they become either too hittable or not competitive. Funderburk spent about a month at Triple-A, made the team out of camp, and every time he goes back down to Triple-A, he strikes everybody out. There's one farmer's return throw. Not in time as McCarthy runs well, so Barnhart down to third. Gurriel is retired, so runners at the corners, one out and the batter will be Kevin Newman. And Alu Francys. Come on. I'm just thinking about it all day as they made out of my lineup car with David Festa on the mound and a Newman batting today for Arizona, there was some Seinfeld tie ins there, the Festivus on the mound, and a hello, Newman, but it just did not mesh at any point. I feel like it has to be a little bit of a Seinfeld ism to mesh it by saying that you couldn't mesh it right? Say it without saying it. Yeah, like I'm going to tell you this story and I'm going to make it fit together by telling you that I couldn't make it fit together. Hence the plot line behind the famous episode of the contest. And we'll leave it at that. Okay And let people kind of dive in to that one. Newman says hello to this flyball, and Buxton does the same. And there are two down as a run scores sac fly for Newman. His second RBI today is 13 to 6. So two down here in the eighth inning. Twins have one more stop on this long road trip. It's off to Seattle. First place Mariners await Bailey Ober has the ball tomorrow night, then Pablo, then Joe Ryan against Seattle. Starting tomorrow night, Wynns live starts at 8:00. Right here on Bally Sports. One out Logan Gilbert will Gau for the Mariners tomorrow night. Then Bryce Miller on Saturday. And Seattle has yet to name a starter for Sunday. And Ke'Bryan woo! He was lined up to pitch in that upcoming series, but he's back on the IL twins will not see him.Bassitt to right from Perdomo as McCarthy will hold at second base. So A2A day for Hiraldo Perdomo. Now, Houston is 500 for I believe the first time all year. It's been a slow crawl back. They looked like they were playing better baseball than the twins were down there. They kind of started to pick it up a little bit. Offense getting going and that'll be a that'll be a tight finish there. For José Marn twins have played well against the American League West and hopefully can add to that this weekend in Seattle. Jose Herrera will not bat. Instead, it's veteran Randal Grichuk. His first appearance in this series. Arizona pretty much platooning at DH with Peterson and Grichuk. Former Saint Louis Cardinals Toronto Blue Jay. Who's been good here at home and it's 0 and 2. Overall batting 321 with runners in scoring position. Picked up his 1,000th career hit on April 23rd in Saint Louis, and Funderburk makes quick work out of Grichuk strikes him out on three pitches and the inning is over. Diamondbacks score one ninth inning coming up. Twins lead, 13 six.Labaut. The.Top. Now starts your 4th of July weekend. A day early. And join the twins for post game fireworks on July 3rd.

Twins are back home Tuesday, Detroit for three and the aforementioned Astros will be in town over the weekend. July 5th, sixth and seven. Joe Mantiply induces quite a bit of chase, and he has the ninth inning as the twins are coming up, leading 13 to 6 also hasn't given up a homer in 55 games. I suppose when you're getting guys to chase out of the zone, you're probably not hitting home runs. Yeah, Willie Castro has been hitting home runs. A little bat from the right side. Homer from this side. Yesterday Willie. Willie two for four a A triple and RBI has scored two runs. Slice. Foul and will land off the net. Mantiply. He was an all star with Arizona in 2022. And 69 games era is in the high twos. And a bunch of changes defensively for Arizona. Randal Grichuk stays in now he's in right Jake McCarthy in left Tucker Barnhart catching and Lourdes Gurriel Jr is now at first as Castro strikes out at a changeup. So one down we have an update on Carlos Correa. Let's bring back in Andrew Martin. Guys we can breathe a little sigh of relief. Just got word from the twins that Carlos Correa has a right wrist contusion. He did have x Rays. They came back negative for any fracture. So right now he is considered day to day. We'll have more information. Obviously following the game. But all things considered that's pretty encouraging. It looked like it could have been a lot worse. Yeah. Well said there. Aldrem good news. So the initial initial news is good out of the twins clubhouse, some imaging done and nothing broken and certainly good news to report on Correa. Thanks Aldry. Farmer hits it high and deep to center sending Corbin Carroll back. Still going and Carroll makes the play up against the padding and center. Farmer still without a home run. And another ballparks maybe a chance but not here. Nice play by Carroll. Right at the base of the wall as well. And I mentioned it earlier. You play shallow here in center field because of the ricochets. You can get off that center field wall. So he had to go a long way to get that ball. It's only I mean not only but it's 407ft to straightaway center field. It's pretty standard distance. But when you play shallow a long way to run the ball is a home run. In 13 ballparks. Target field is not one of them. Fenway. Wrigley. Cincinnati. White Sox. Angels. Dodgers. The Waukee Oakland, PNC Park. Petco. Oracle with the Giants play Busch Stadium and Rogers Center. That's the home run. Margot laces one to center field. Carroll and runs this one down with that great speed. Couple of Well-hit balls here from farmer and Margot. But Carroll with a couple of good plays. And the twins go down 123 here in the ninth inning. Three outs away from victory. And a series win here in Phoenix.These are three outs away from a series win, leading 13 to 6. As we head to the bottom of the ninth.

Another inning here for Cody Funderburk and Corbin Carroll, zero for four today. Leads off the ninth. One and two. Cleveland and Kansas City begin a four game series at Kauffman Stadium tonight. And Carroll strikes out . And that's the sequence we were talking about last inning against the left handed bat. Good slider right there from Cody Funderburk. And that's the spot that's just off the outside corner. Looks like a strike for a long time. No chance for Corbin Carroll. That's the one that he's got to find. Got to be able to repeat that pitch right there. Blaise Alexander and he's hit by a pitch at 94. And down he goes. Charlie horse. And Alexander will get some help to his feet as a member of the athletic training staff. Is out to take a look at the Arizona second baseman. You read anything into that? We're on a day like today. Byron Buxton was hit. Carlos Correa was hit. Does the disclaimer I read count for anything? Yes yes, that's that's how the game is played. And. Got him in a fine spot. Shook him up a little bit. You get you hit Byron Buxton in the elbow. You hit Carlos Correa in the wrist. I don't think anybody in either dugout a surprise about what just happened. Alexander being given some time to jog a bit off the right field line. And he will stay in this game. Joc Pederson, one for 11 in this series. Now. Designated hitter Enderson. Liranzo. Jerson. Carlos Correa got pinched or got hit in the top of the seventh. Bottom of the seventh. Corbin Carroll ground out. Ketel Marte pinch hit for by Blaise Alexander. Reminds me of when Ozzie Guillen used to take A.J. Pierzynski out of a game after he did something that was going to get him hit. Oh, one count to Pederson. And that one misses outside. In your career, was that was that a field thing? Just watch. You didn't need any instruction. Just watching the game and maybe watching his series play out. That I know what I have to do here. Yep Yeah. And how to say this. Always a good start. I had to do it one time. I had to do it one time. I got myself caught up in a couple other ones inadvertently, ironically, both against the Tigers. I was a starter. It was at the Metrodome. Carlos Guillen was leading off the game and I struggled against him. And I think it might have even been the first pitch of the game. I was just trying to throw like a two seam fastball in, and it went right at his head. He got out of the way, they buckling Breaking ball Purroy sorry. And Peterson's out. Number two. Another good slider to a lefty as well, but I threw the ball. He got out of the way and the Tigers decided that I did that on purpose. And so they went and hit Mauer and Morneau. And then the other time was at Comerica Park in Detroit. And you can't see the field, you can't see home plate from the bullpen. And I'm throwing warming up, and I come in the game and as I'm coming in, they're announcing that we just changed right fielders. I think Kubel was going out to play right or something like that. We had a substitution in right field and I'm like, oh, that's weird. It's the game's a blowout. Brandon Inge is up. I hit him in the calf and I get warmed and I'm like, what the heck? Just happened? Well, whoever was playing right field before had gotten hit the inning previous. Unbeknownst to me. And so they were mad about that one. But there was one time that I, and nobody had to tell me. It was a situation where, you know what's going on and those things sometimes have to be settled on the field. I think everybody is okay with that. There was nothing here that anybody was on edge. I think, like I said, everybody in the dugouts had a pretty good idea of what was going to happen. Two down, bottom nine and the one one to Barnhart. Stay tuned to Wynns. Live post game is coming up. Strike three and this one is over the twins win their second straight road series. The rubber game. Today. Byron Buxton and the twins offense erupting again. Willi Castro two more hits, another extra base hit. And congratulations to David Festa. He is a winner in his major league debut, but this twins offense is red hot. 13 more runs today and the twins are now 45 and 36 and back to back winning series to begin this three city road trip. All three games were anbsolute laser show by the twins offense. They found enough holes last night and today to put up some runs and yes, congratutions to David Festa. Good debut. Get that first win near a major leaguer and he's getting ready to talk about his day with Chris and Danny on the radio. 13 six the final. Stay tuned. Twins live post game with Katie and Trevor Plouffe is coming up next right here on Bally\n"
